Description: Integrative clustering and semi-supervised prediction.
  This package includes a C++ implementation of both semi-supervised and 
  unsupervised Multiple Dataset Integration, an extension of Bayesian mixture models
  to the integrative (multiple dataset) setting (e.g., multi-omics). It also 
  includes Bayesian mixture models. Densities allowed within MDI and the mixture
  model are Gaussian with full and diagonal covariance matrices ('MVN' and 'G'), 
  categorical ('C'), Gaussian with a Gaussian process prior on the mean 
  parameter ('GP'). The GP model can only handle data with common time points of
  equal separation. The MVN and GP models can be augmented with a global 
  multivariate t distribution to handle outliers (called using 'TAGM' and 
  'TAGPM').
