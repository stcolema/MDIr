Description: Integrative clustering and semi-supervised prediction.
  This package includes a C++ implementation of both semi-supervised and 
  un-supervised Multiple Dataset Integration, an extension of Bayesian mixture models
  to the integrative (multiple dataset) setting. It also includes Bayesian 
  mixture models. Densities allowed within MDI and the mixture model are 
  Gaussian with full and diagonal covariance matrices ('MVN' and 'G'), 
  categorical ('C'), Gaussian with a Gaussian process prior on the mean 
  parameter ('GP'). The GP model can only handle data with common time points of
  equal separation. The MVN and GP models can be augmented with a global 
  multivariate t distribution to handle outliers (called using 'TAGM' and 
  'TAGPM').
