Description: Integrative clustering and semi-supervised prediction.
  This package includes a 'C++' implementation of both semi-supervised and 
  unsupervised Multiple Dataset Integration (MDI), an extension of Bayesian 
  mixture models to the integrative (multiple dataset or multi-modal) setting 
  such as multi-omics analysis. The package also includes Bayesian mixture models. 
  Densities allowed within MDI and the mixture model are Gaussian with full and 
  diagonal covariance matrices, categorical, Gaussian with a Gaussian process 
  (GP) prior on the mean parameter. The GP model can only handle data with 
  common time points of equal separation. The Gaussian and GP models can be 
  augmented with a global multivariate t distribution to handle outliers.
